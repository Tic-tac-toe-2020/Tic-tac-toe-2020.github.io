## Project Information
We started this project because we want to calculate the probability of winning the Tic-Tac-Toe game, to verificate the rumor of this game.<br />
Each release contains a zip file with
*  project file(.sb3)
*  needed inport file(.txt)
*  outcome file(.txt)
*  project script(.json)
<br /><br />
PS: Each release are made for differen't uses. So V1.6 can't replace V1.4
## Getting Started
You can downlode the zip file at [Our Site](https://tic-tac-toe-2020.github.io/)
### Prerequisites of .SB3

To open the .sb3 file, you need to downlode [Scratch Destop](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) or use the [web version](https://scratch.mit.edu/). All of the other code can be open by Chrome.
